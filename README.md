# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Predictions

## Overview
This project explores the impact of COVID-19 across 223 countries using data from 2019 to 2022. It applies clustering and regression models to analyze country performance during the pandemic, predict confirmed cases, and identify patterns to inform government policies.

## Project Details
- **Duration:** [Insert Duration, e.g., Sep 2023 â€“ Dec 2023]
- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Key Objectives
1. Analyze COVID-19 trends and identify country performance using clustering techniques.
2. Predict confirmed COVID-19 cases using regression models.
3. Provide insights for better decision-making and policy formation.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values and outliers.
  - Normalized numerical features and encoded categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
  - Identified country clusters and their characteristics.
- **Clustering:**
  - Applied K-Means for clustering countries based on pandemic performance.
  - Optimized clusters using the Elbow method and Dendrograms.
- **Regression Modeling:**
  - Used Polynomial Regression for predicting confirmed cases based on non-linear trends.
  - Compared with Linear Regression to improve accuracy.

## Results
- Slower growth of confirmed and death cases observed over time.
- Identified countries needing policy improvements to mitigate pandemic impact.
- Improved regression model accuracy using polynomial transformations.
